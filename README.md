# Admin Dashboard

## This is an exercise from the Odin project to replicate a webpage to better help understand Grid

### Current work - I have completed the outline of how I want things to look like relative to the [template](project design file)

Bugs:

1. There's a white boarder around the page
2. Unresponsive units
3. Border of main grid are still active
4. No gap on main grid
